    Retrieve expert metrics from the database for the specified date range.

    This function queries the database to fetch various expert metrics such as chat matches, chat similarity,
    chat click rate, search matches, average search rank, and search click rate. The metrics are calculated
    for each expert and returned as a pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    - conn: psycopg2 connection object representing the database connection.
    - start_date (datetime): The start date of the date range.
    - end_date (datetime): The end date of the date range.
    - expert_count (int): The number of experts to include in the result.
